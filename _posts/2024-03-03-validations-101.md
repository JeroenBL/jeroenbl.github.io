Most target connectors are structured in a very similar manner and, with good reason. Having the same look and feel provides familiarity. The code base feels 'at home', is easy to navigate through and you instantly know where a specific piece of code can be found. 

The way code is structured plays a crucial role in this and, validations form an integral part of the connector code structure. Based on their outcome, different actions are invoked.

In this post, we'll talk about the fundamentals of __validations__ within the _create_ lifecycle action and how validations and structure relates to __HelloID__.

### HelloID

Within __HelloID__ we can differentiate two modes. 

- [__Enforcement__](https://docs.helloid.com/en/provisioning/enforcement.html)<br> 
Commonly referred to as _production_ mode. _Enforcement_ is the process where __HelloID__ actually performs a _grant_, _revoke or modification_ of an account or entitlement.

- __Preview__<br>
In _preview_ mode, you can see what what will happen with a particular [person](https://docs.helloid.com/en/provisioning/persons.html) during an enforcement.

**TIP**
If you look at this from a pure PowerShell perspective, you can compare _preview_ mode with _-WhatIf_. Its a form of risk mitigation.

**TIP**
It is advisable to first test your code in preview mode before proceeding with enforcement.

### PowerShell

When we build the [V2 templates](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-V2-Template) we’ve tried to structure the code in logical manner. Quite literally from A-Z. We believe that, structuring the code like book, helps understanding the code and all its processes.

Here’s an example of our `create` lifecycle action.

```powershell
try {
    # Validation
    try {
        $splatParams = @{
            Uri    = "https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users/$($actionContext.Data.ExternalId)"
            Method = 'GET'
        }
        $correlatedAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
    } catch {
        if ($exception.Response.StatusCode -eq 'NotFound'){
            $correlatedAccount = $null
        } else {
            throw
        }
    }

    # Determine actions
    if ($null -eq $correlatedAccount) {
        $action = 'CreateAccount'
    } else {
        $action = 'CorrelateAccount'
        $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.id
    }

    # Preview actions
    if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true) {
        Write-Information "$action account will be executed during enforcement"
    }
        
    # Enforce actions
    if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)) {
        switch ($action) {
            'CreateAccount' {
                $splatParams = @{
                    Uri    = 'https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users'
                    Method = 'POST'
                    Body   = $actionContext.Data | ConvertTo-Json
                }
                $createdAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
                $outputContext.AccountReference = $createdAccount.Id
            }

            'CorrelateAccount' {
                $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.Id
            }
        }

        $outputContext.success = $true
    }
} catch {
	# Main error handling
}
```

#### Validation

Every `create` story begins with validations. At the most basic level, we need to determine whether an account needs to be created or correlated.

```powershell
$splatParams = @{
    Uri    = "https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users/$($actionContext.Data.ExternalId)"
    Method = 'GET'
}
$correlatedAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
```

**TIP**
Notice that we wrapped this in a nested `try/catch` block because we don’t want the lifecycle action to fail in case we get back a `404-NotFound`.
{: .notice--info}

#### Determine actions

The next step is to determine which process _(referred to as action)_ needs to be executed. 

In this example, we check if the `$correlatedAccount` variable is `$null` and set the `$action` variable to _CreateAccount_ if that's true.

```powershell
if ($null -eq $correlatedAccount) {
    $action = 'CreateAccount'
} else {
    $action = 'CorrelateAccount'
    $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.id
}
```

The next step depends on which mode we’re running in.

#### Preview

**TIP**
All the _preview_ logic is encapsulated within the `if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)` block.
{: .notice--info}

In _preview_ mode, we display an informational message that indicates what will occur during an enforcement. 

**TIP**
This functionality is _somewhat_ comparable to the `-WhatIf` parameter in PowerShell.
{: .notice--info}

```powershell
if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true) {
    Write-Information "$action account will be executed during enforcement"
}
```

#### Enforcement

**TIP**
All the _enforcement_ logic is encapsulated within the `if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)` block.
{: .notice--info}

In _enforcement_ mode,  we differentiate two actions: 

- __CreateAccount__<br>
    The process in which we actually make `HTTP.POST` calls to our application. 
    If the account creation is successful, we also perform correlation.

- __CorrelateAccount__<br>
    If the account is returned in our validation and `$correlatedAccount` contains the actual account object, we extract the `Id` and assign it to the `$outputContext.AccountReference` variable for correlation.

```powershell
if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)) {
    switch ($action) {
        'CreateAccount' {
            $splatParams = @{
                Uri    = 'https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users'
                Method = 'POST'
                Body   = $actionContext.Data | ConvertTo-Json
            }
            $createdAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
            $outputContext.AccountReference = $createdAccount.Id
        }

        'CorrelateAccount' {
            $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.Id
        }
    }

    $outputContext.success = $true
}
```

### `try/catch`

Notice we’ve wrapped all our logic into one main `try/catch` block. This ensures that error handling is easy to follow and that we always provide __HelloID__ with clean error messages in case something unfortunate happens.

**WARNING**
We do not encourage the use of nested `try/catch` blocks. This approach can make error handling more difficult to follow and is unnecessary in most cases.
{: .notice--warning}
 
### If you have multiple validations

There are many occasions where we need to validate more then just the account. For example, an account may require manager and departmental information. 

- For existing accounts this means we need to validate if the current information is correct and, we need to consider that, in _preview_ mode, we __always__ show what happens during an _enforcement_. _This includes __all__ details._

**TIP** 
We not only want to see that an account will be created or correlated. But also, which manager and department will be assigned.
{: .notice--info}

Here’s an example of our `create` lifecycle action with multiple validations.

```powershell
# Validate account
try {
    $splatParams = @{
        Uri    = "https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users/$($actionContext.Data.ExternalId)"
        Method = 'GET'
    }
    $correlatedAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
} catch {
    if ($exception.Response.StatusCode -eq 'NotFound'){
        $correlatedAccount = $null
    } else {
        throw
    }
}

# Determine actions
if ($null -eq $correlatedAccount) {
    $parentAction = 'CreateAccount'
    $dryRunMessage = "CreateAccount will be executed during enforcement. Manager ExternalId set to: [$personContext.Person.PrimaryManager.ExternalId]. DepartmentDisplayName set to: [$personContext.PrimaryContract.Department.DisplayName)]"
} else {
    $parentAction = 'CorrelateAccount'
    $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.id
    $dryRunMessage = "CorrelateAccount will be executed during enforcement.`n"
    
    # Define empty list that will contain our childActions.
    $childActions = [System.Collections.Generic.List[object]]::new()

    # Validate manager
    if ($correlatedAccount.Manager.ExternalId -ne ($personContext.Person.PrimaryManager.ExternalId)){
        $dryRunMessage += "Manager ExternalId set to: [$personContext.Person.PrimaryManager.ExternalId]`n"
        $childActions.Add('UpdateManager')
    }

    # Validate department
    if ($correlatedAccount.Department.DisplayName -ne ($personContext.PrimaryContract.Department.DisplayName)){
        $dryRunMessage += "DepartmentDisplayName set to: [$personContext.PrimaryContract.Department.DisplayName)]"
        $childActions.Add('UpdateDepartment')
    }
}

# Preview actions
if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true) {
    Write-Information $dryRunMessage
}

# Enforce actions
if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)) {
    switch ($parentAction) {
        'CreateAccount' {
            # CreateAccount logic
        }

        'CorrelateAccount' {
            # CorrelateAccount logic
        }
    }

    # childActions
    foreach ($childAction in $childActions) {
        switch ($childActions) {
            'UpdateManager' {
                # UpdateManager logic
            }

            'UpdateDepartment' {
                # UpdateDepartment logic
            }
        }
    }

    $outputContext.success = $true
}
```

#### Validation

The account validation remains the same.

#### Determine actions

Our _determine actions_ code block, however, is where things are different.

We still determine which action needs to be executed. In this scenario, we refer to it as the `$parentAction`: either _CreateAccount_ or _CorrelateAccount_.

- If the account needs to be created, we can simply extract the manager and departmental information from the `$personContext`.
  
- If the account already exists and we only need to correlate, we need to ensure that the _manager_ and _departmental_ details are valid.
If not, we add two different _childActions_ to the `$childActions` array: _UpdateManager_ and _UpdateDepartment_.

Note that we also build up a `$dryRunMessage` variable with the correct information message.

```powershell
if ($null -eq $correlatedAccount) {
    $parentAction = 'CreateAccount'
    $dryRunMessage = "CreateAccount will be executed during enforcement. Manager ExternalId set to: [$personContext.Person.PrimaryManager.ExternalId]. DepartmentDisplayName set to: [$personContext.PrimaryContract.Department.DisplayName)]"
} else {
    $parentAction = 'CorrelateAccount'
    $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.id
    $dryRunMessage = "CorrelateAccount will be executed during enforcement.`n"
    
    # Define empty list that will contain our childActions.
    $childActions = [System.Collections.Generic.List[object]]::new()

    # Validate manager
    if ($correlatedAccount.Manager.ExternalId -ne ($personContext.Person.PrimaryManager.ExternalId)){
        $dryRunMessage += "Manager ExternalId set to: [$personContext.Person.PrimaryManager.ExternalId]`n"
        $childActions.Add('UpdateManager')
    }

    # Validate department
    if ($correlatedAccount.Department.DisplayName -ne ($personContext.PrimaryContract.Department.DisplayName)){
        $dryRunMessage += "DepartmentDisplayName set to: [$personContext.PrimaryContract.Department.DisplayName)]"
        $childActions.Add('UpdateDepartment')
    }
}
```

#### Preview actions

In _preview_ mode, we display an informational message that indicates what will occur during an enforcement.

```powershell
if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true) {
    Write-Information $dryRunMessage
}
```

#### Enforce actions

The _enforcement_ logic remains largely the same. We still have two `$parentActions`.

- __CreateAccount__
    This is we actually make `HTTP.POST` calls to our application. If the account creation is successful, we also perform correlation.

- __CorrelateAccount__
    In addition to correlation, we also loop through the list of `$childActions`.

```powershell
if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)) {
    switch ($parentAction) {
        'CreateAccount' {
            # CreateAccount logic
        }

        'CorrelateAccount' {
            # CorrelateAccount logic
        }
    }

    # childActions
    foreach ($childAction in $childActions) {
        switch ($childActions) {
            'UpdateManager' {
                # UpdateManager logic
            }

            'UpdateDepartment' {
                # UpdateDepartment logic
            }
        }
    }

    $outputContext.success = $true
}
```

## Wrapping Up

We've covered the fundamentals of validations within the `create` lifecycle action. Hopefully we could provide some helpful guidance on how to structure your connector.
