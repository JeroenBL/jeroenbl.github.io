When we build the [V2 templates](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-V2-Template) we’ve tried to structure the code in logical manner. Quite literally from A-Z. We believe that, structuring the code like a book, helps understanding the code and all its processes. Additionally, having uniformity in code structure across all connectors also provides a sense of familiarity. You instinctively know where a specific piece of code can be found. 

Validations form an integral part of the code stucture. Based on their outcome, different actions are invoked. 

In this post, we'll talk about the fundamentals of __validations__ within the _create_ lifecycle stage and how validations and structure relate to __HelloID__.

### `create` lifecycle stage

Here’s an example of the `create` lifecycle stage code.

```powershell
try {
    # Validation
    try {
        $splatParams = @{
            Uri    = "https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users/$($actionContext.Data.ExternalId)"
            Method = 'GET'
        }
        $correlatedAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
    } catch {
        if ($exception.Response.StatusCode -eq 'NotFound'){
            $correlatedAccount = $null
        } else {
            throw
        }
    }

    # Determine actions
    if ($null -eq $correlatedAccount) {
        $action = 'CreateAccount'
    } else {
        $action = 'CorrelateAccount'
    }

    # Preview actions
    if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true) {
        Write-Information "$action account will be executed during enforcement"
    }
        
    # Enforce actions
    if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)) {
        switch ($action) {
            'CreateAccount' {
                $splatParams = @{
                    Uri    = 'https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users'
                    Method = 'POST'
                    Body   = $actionContext.Data | ConvertTo-Json
                }
                $createdAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
                $outputContext.AccountReference = $createdAccount.Id
            }

            'CorrelateAccount' {
                $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.Id
            }
        }

        $outputContext.success = $true
    }
} catch {
	# Main error handling
}
```

### Validation

Every `create` story begins with validations. 

At its simplest, we have to determine whether an account needs to be created or correlated. This is what we refer to as a _validation_. In the example above, we validate if an account for a specific person exists. 

**TIP**
Initially, the internal database `Id` is not known to us. Therefore, we prefer to validate this using the `EmployeeId` or `ExternalId` since this is unique and available within __HelloID__.
{: .notice--info}

```powershell
try {
    $splatParams = @{
        Uri    = "https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users/$($actionContext.Data.ExternalId)"
        Method = 'GET'
    }
    $correlatedAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
} catch {
    if ($exception.Response.StatusCode -eq 'NotFound'){
        $correlatedAccount = $null
    } else {
        throw
    }
}
```

**TIP**
Notice that we wrapped this in a nested `try/catch` block because we don’t want the lifecycle stage to fail in case we get back a `404-NotFound`.
{: .notice--info}

#### Actions

The result of a validation always results in an action. Within the `create` lifecycle stage, we identify two actions.

- _CreateAccount_
- _CorrelateAccount_

```powershell
if ($null -eq $correlatedAccount) {
    $action = 'CreateAccount'
} else {
    $action = 'CorrelateAccount'}
```

If `$correlatedAccount` equals to `$null` we set the `$action` variable to _CreateAccount_. If `$correlatedAccount` not equals to `$null` we set `$action` to _CorrelateAccount_.

#### Mode

Depending on which mode you're running in, different code blocks are invoked.

- [Preview mode](#preview)
- [Enforcement mode](#enforcement)

##### Preview

In _preview_ mode, you will see what happens with a particular [person](https://docs.helloid.com/en/provisioning/persons.html) during an enforcement. This functionality is _somewhat_ comparable to the `-WhatIf` parameter in PowerShell.

**TIP**
All the _preview_ logic will need to be encapsulated within the `if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)` block. 
{: .notice--info}

```powershell
if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true) {
    Write-Information "$action account will be executed during enforcement"
}
```

##### Enforcement

Commonly referred to as _production_ mode. [Enforcement]((https://docs.helloid.com/en/provisioning/enforcement.html)) is the process where __HelloID__ actually performs a _grant_, _revoke or modification_ of an account or entitlement.

**TIP**
All the _enforcement_ logic is encapsulated within the `if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)` block.
{: .notice--info}

```powershell
if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)) {
    switch ($action) {
        'CreateAccount' {
            $splatParams = @{
                Uri    = 'https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users'
                Method = 'POST'
                Body   = $actionContext.Data | ConvertTo-Json
            }
            $createdAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
            $outputContext.AccountReference = $createdAccount.Id
        }

        'CorrelateAccount' {
            $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.Id
        }
    }

    $outputContext.success = $true
}
```

If the account is returned in our validation and `$correlatedAccount` does contain the actual account object, we extract the `Id` and assign it to the `$outputContext.AccountReference` variable for correlation.

### `try/catch`

Notice we’ve wrapped all our logic into one main `try/catch` block. This ensures that error handling is easy to follow and that we always provide __HelloID__ with clean error messages in case something unfortunate happens.

**WARNING**
We do not encourage the use of nested `try/catch` blocks. This approach can make error handling more difficult to follow and is unnecessary in most cases.

## Wrapping Up

We've covered the fundamentals of validations within the `create` lifecycle action. Hopefully we could provide some helpful guidance on how to structure your connector.

### What's next

Developing a connector requires extensive knowledge of _PowerShell_ and _HelloID_ provisioning. If you don't know where to go from here, there are plenty of resources that can help you.

#### Samples

We have a huge collection of connectors available on the [Tools4ever GitHub](https://github.com/Tools4everBV) repository you can adapt from. 

#### Example API

We have also created an [example API](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/Basic-Example-Target-API) that may provide insight into what is expected for HelloID.
