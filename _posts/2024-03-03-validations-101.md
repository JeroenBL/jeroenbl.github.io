When we build the [V2 templates](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-V2-Template) we’ve tried to structure the code in a logical manner. Quite literally from A-Z. We believe that, structuring the code like a book, helps understanding the code and all its processes. Additionally, having uniformity in code structure across all connectors also provides a sense of familiarity. You instinctively know where a specific piece of code can be found. 

Validations form an integral part of this structure. Based on their outcome, different actions are invoked. 

In this post, we'll talk about the fundamentals of __validations__ within the _create_ lifecycle stage and how validations -and structure- relate to __HelloID__.

### `create` lifecycle stage

Here’s an example of the `create` lifecycle stage code.

```powershell
try {
    # Validation
    try {
        $splatParams = @{
            Uri    = "https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users/$($actionContext.Data.ExternalId)"
            Method = 'GET'
        }
        $correlatedAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
    } catch {
        if ($exception.Response.StatusCode -eq 'NotFound'){
            $correlatedAccount = $null
        } else {
            throw
        }
    }

    # Determine actions
    if ($null -eq $correlatedAccount) {
        $action = 'CreateAccount'
    } else {
        $action = 'CorrelateAccount'
    }

    # Preview actions
    if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true) {
        Write-Information "$action account will be executed during enforcement"
    }
        
    # Enforce actions
    if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)) {
        switch ($action) {
            'CreateAccount' {
                $splatParams = @{
                    Uri    = 'https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users'
                    Method = 'POST'
                    Body   = $actionContext.Data | ConvertTo-Json
                }
                $createdAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
                $outputContext.AccountReference = $createdAccount.Id
            }

            'CorrelateAccount' {
                $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.Id
            }
        }

        $outputContext.success = $true
    }
} catch {
	# Main error handling
}
```

### Validation

Every `create` story begins with validations. 

At its simplest, we have to determine whether an account needs to be created or correlated. This is what we refer to as a _validation_. In the code example above, we validate if an account for a specific person exists. 

**TIP**
Initially, the internal database `Id` is not known to us. Therefore, we prefer to validate this using the `EmployeeId` or `ExternalId` since this is unique and available within __HelloID__.
{: .notice--info}

```powershell
try {
    $splatParams = @{
        Uri    = "https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users/$($actionContext.Data.ExternalId)"
        Method = 'GET'
    }
    $correlatedAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
} catch {
    if ($exception.Response.StatusCode -eq 'NotFound'){
        $correlatedAccount = $null
    } else {
        throw
    }
}
```

**TIP**
Notice that we wrapped this in a nested `try/catch` block because we don’t want the lifecycle stage to fail in case we get back a `404-NotFound`.
{: .notice--info}

#### Actions

The outcome of a validation always results in an action. Within the `create` lifecycle stage, we identify two actions.

- _CreateAccount_
- _CorrelateAccount_

```powershell
if ($null -eq $correlatedAccount) {
    $action = 'CreateAccount'
} else {
    $action = 'CorrelateAccount'}
```

If `$correlatedAccount` equals to `$null` we set the `$action` variable to _CreateAccount_. If `$correlatedAccount` not equals to `$null` we set `$action` to _CorrelateAccount_.

Technically its not necessary to have a separate action for _CorrelateAccount_. The reason its there is because we believe that, having a separate action, maintains readability. 

#### Mode

Depending on which mode you're running in, different code blocks are executed.

- [Preview mode](#preview)
- [Enforcement mode](#enforcement)

##### Preview

In _preview_ mode, you will see what happens with a particular [person](https://docs.helloid.com/en/provisioning/persons.html) during enforcement. This functionality is _somewhat_ comparable to the `-WhatIf` switch in PowerShell.

**TIP**
All the _preview_ logic will need to be encapsulated within the `if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)` block. 
{: .notice--info}

```powershell
if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true) {
    Write-Information "$action account will be executed during enforcement"
}
```

##### Enforcement

Commonly referred to as _production_ mode. [Enforcement]((https://docs.helloid.com/en/provisioning/enforcement.html)) is the process where __HelloID__ actually performs a _grant_, _revoke or modification_ of an account or entitlement.

**TIP**
All the _enforcement_ logic is encapsulated within the `if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)` block.
{: .notice--info}

```powershell
if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)) {
    switch ($action) {
        'CreateAccount' {
            $splatParams = @{
                Uri    = 'https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users'
                Method = 'POST'
                Body   = $actionContext.Data | ConvertTo-Json
            }
            $createdAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
            $outputContext.AccountReference = $createdAccount.Id
        }

        'CorrelateAccount' {
            $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.Id
        }
    }

    $outputContext.success = $true
}
```

If the account is returned in our validation and `$correlatedAccount` does contain the actual account object, we extract the `Id` and assign it to the `$outputContext.AccountReference` variable for correlation. 

### `try/catch`

Notice we’ve wrapped all our logic into one main `try/catch` block. This ensures that error handling is easy to follow and that we always provide __HelloID__ with clean error messages in case something unfortunate happens.

**WARNING**
We do not encourage the use of nested `try/catch` blocks. This approach can make error handling more difficult to follow and is unnecessary in most cases.
{: .notice--warning}

## What if there are more validations

There are many occasions where we need to validate more then just the account. For example, an account may require manager and departmental information. 

Keep in mind that, in __preview__ mode, we __always__ want to see the actions that will be executed during __enforcement__. This includes the outcome of each validation. If, for example, the manager needs to be updated, we expect to see that __preview__ mode. 

The following code example demonstrates how multiple validations can be used.

```powershell
# Validate account
try {
    $splatParams = @{
        Uri    = "https://api.example.enyoi/api/v1/users/$($actionContext.Data.ExternalId)"
        Method = 'GET'
    }
    $correlatedAccount = Invoke-RestMethod @splatParams
} catch {
    if ($exception.Response.StatusCode -eq 'NotFound'){
        $correlatedAccount = $null
    } else {
        throw
    }
}

# Determine actions
if ($null -eq $correlatedAccount) {
    $parentAction = 'CreateAccount'
    $dryRunMessage = "CreateAccount will be executed during enforcement. Manager ExternalId set to: [$personContext.Person.PrimaryManager.ExternalId]. DepartmentDisplayName set to: [$personContext.PrimaryContract.Department.DisplayName)]"
} else {
    $parentAction = 'CorrelateAccount'
    $outputContext.AccountReference = $correlatedAccount.id
    $dryRunMessage = "CorrelateAccount will be executed during enforcement.`n"
    
    # Define empty list that will contain our childActions.
    $childActions = [System.Collections.Generic.List[object]]::new()

    # Validate manager
    if ($correlatedAccount.Manager.ExternalId -ne ($personContext.Person.PrimaryManager.ExternalId)){
        $dryRunMessage += "Manager ExternalId set to: [$personContext.Person.PrimaryManager.ExternalId]`n"
        $childActions.Add('UpdateManager')
    }

    # Validate department
    if ($correlatedAccount.Department.DisplayName -ne ($personContext.PrimaryContract.Department.DisplayName)){
        $dryRunMessage += "DepartmentDisplayName set to: [$personContext.PrimaryContract.Department.DisplayName)]"
        $childActions.Add('UpdateDepartment')
    }
}

# Preview actions
if ($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true) {
    Write-Information $dryRunMessage
}

# Enforce actions
if (-not($actionContext.DryRun -eq $true)) {
    switch ($parentAction) {
        'CreateAccount' {
            # CreateAccount logic
        }

        'CorrelateAccount' {
            # CorrelateAccount logic
        }
    }

    # childActions
    foreach ($childAction in $childActions) {
        switch ($childActions) {
            'UpdateManager' {
                # UpdateManager logic
            }

            'UpdateDepartment' {
                # UpdateDepartment logic
            }
        }
    }

    $outputContext.success = $true
}
```
 
## Wrapping Up

We've covered the fundamentals of validations within the `create` lifecycle action. Hopefully we could provide some guidance on how to structure your connector.

### What's next

Developing a connector requires extensive knowledge of _PowerShell_ and _HelloID_ provisioning. If you don't know where to go from here, there are plenty of resources that can help you.

#### Samples

We have a huge collection of connectors available on the [Tools4ever GitHub](https://github.com/Tools4everBV) repository you can adapt from. 

#### Example API

We've also created an [example API](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/Basic-Example-Target-API) that may provide insight into what is expected for HelloID.
